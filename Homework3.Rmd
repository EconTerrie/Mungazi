```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Question1
```
Find: \s{2,} 
 Replace: 
 ```
 I searched for two spaces between words and then replaced with a comma.
 
 Question2
 ```
Find: (\w+),\s*(\w+), (.*)
 Replace:\2 \1 (\3)
 ```
 
 I first captured the whole thing w+ to indicate that it's the first word and it's followed by a comma and space which followed by a word and than I define the rest with .*. I then placed characters of interest in parenthesis. I reordered by switching 1 and 2 placing a space to replace the comma and placing parenthesis on the last 3rd part.
 
 
 Question3
 ```
 Find: (.mp3)(\s)
 Replace: \1\n
 ```
 
 I considered the last set of characters and the space and than I placed separate parenthesis on both, I then defined the position of break and followed it with the appropriate command.
