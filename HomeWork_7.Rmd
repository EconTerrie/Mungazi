### My hypothesis is that marijuana policy would result in the highest awareness level of hemp-based products because of the entanglement between marijauna and hemp over the past years. Hemp policy would the second highest and no policy would have the lowest level of awareness.

```{R}
nGroup <- 3 # number of treatment groups
nName <- c("no_pollicy","hemp_policy", "marijuana_policy") # names of groups
nSize <- c(35,24,29) # number of observations in each group
nMean <- c(8,10,16) # mean of each group
nSD <- c(5,5,5) # standard deviation of each group
```

```{R}
ID <- 1:(sum(nSize)) # id vector for each row
aware_count <- c(rnorm(n=nSize[1],mean=nMean[1],sd=nSD[1]),
                 rnorm(n=nSize[2],mean=nMean[2],sd=nSD[2]),
                 rnorm(n=nSize[3],mean=nMean[3],sd=nSD[3]))
TGroup <- rep(nName,nSize)
ANOdata <- data.frame(ID,TGroup,aware_count)
str(ANOdata)
print(ANOdata)
```

```{R}
ANOmodel <- aov(aware_count~TGroup,data=ANOdata)
print(ANOmodel)
print(summary(ANOmodel))
z <- summary(ANOmodel)
str(z)
```

```{R}
ANOPlot <- ggplot(data=ANOdata) + 
  aes(x=TGroup,y=aware_count,fill=TGroup) +
  geom_boxplot()
print(ANOPlot)
```

### The pattern becomes less significant when the differences in means become smaller.
