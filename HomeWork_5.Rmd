## Question 1
```{R}
n_dims <- sample(3:10,1)
consecutive_int <- 1:(n_dims^2) # here I specified the the range of numbers that covers the consecutive integers vector - which is from 1 to "n_dims^2". 
reshuffled_vec <- sample(consecutive_int) # the "sample" command reshuffles the vector of consecutive integers 
squareMat <- matrix(reshuffled_vec,nrow=n_dims,ncol=n_dims) # for the square matrix, I use the reshuffled vectors and then define the matrix row and column length, which in this case are equal and both equal to "n_dims". 
print(squareMat)
```

```{R}
t(squareMat)
print(squareMat)
```

```{R}
sum_first_row <- sum(squareMat[1,])
print(sum_first_row)
```

```{R}
mean_first_row <- mean(squareMat[1,])
print(mean_first_row)
```
